# üç≤ Food Platform - Reducing Food Waste & Ensuring Food Security

## üìö **Project Overview**
This project aims to reduce food waste and ensure food security by creating a digital platform that connects **food donors** (restaurants, supermarkets, individuals) with **recipients** (NGOs, homeless shelters, needy individuals). The platform leverages AI-powered matching, real-time tracking, and volunteer networks to efficiently collect and distribute surplus food.

## üéØ **Key Objectives**
- Minimize food wastage by redistributing surplus food.
- Empower marginalized communities by ensuring food availability.
- Promote community participation and awareness to eradicate hunger.
- Integrate **GrahLaxmi Yojna** registration for improved transparency.

### Step 4: **AI-Based Matching & Allocation**
- AI (Google Gemini API) matches food donations with the nearest recipient.
- Optimizes pickup and delivery routes for volunteers.

### Step 5: **Notification System & Confirmation**
- Real-time notifications sent to donors, recipients, and volunteers.
- Users confirm availability for donation, pickup, and receipt.

### Step 6: **Food Pickup & Delivery**
- Volunteers coordinate pickups and deliveries using Google Maps API.
- Recipients confirm receipt of food after delivery.

### Step 7: **Feedback & Quality Control**
- Recipients rate food quality and service.
- Admins review reports to ensure safety and efficiency.

### Step 8: **Data Analytics & Reporting**
- Generates insights on donations, food wastage reduction, and volunteer efficiency.
